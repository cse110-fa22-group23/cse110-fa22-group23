### Branching

Create a separate branch from the main branch for each issue.

### Pull Requests

Commit and sync your most up-to-date code for the branch you are planning to make a pull request for. At least one other contributor is required to review your code before it is merged to main. Any relevant code must also pass automatic linting and unit tests.
